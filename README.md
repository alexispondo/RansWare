# DESCRIPTION
RansWare is a cryptographic tool based on hybrid (symmetric and asymmetric) encryption that allows encrypting files of any extension on a machine (regardless of the operating system).
Its name comes from the fact that it simulates the activity of crypto-ransomware at the local level (on one's own machine).
The objective is to study how ransomware works, how it spreads on a computer and how to implement solutions and methods to protect oneself from it.
